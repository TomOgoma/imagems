# service configures the Micro-service's runtime profile.
service:

  # registerInterval configures how often a micro-service should ping the front
  # facing Gateway API with alive packets. Formatting is as follows:
  # 2d3h4m5s -> after every "2 days, 3 hours, 4 minutes and 5 seconds"
  registerInterval: 5s

  # dataDir is the /path/to/directory holding all state files for the micro-service
  dataDir: /var/data/imagems

  # imgURL is the publicly accessible URL that the load balancer accepts requests
  # from.
  # - typically the URL which `micro web` is listening on.
  # - the URL must be complete i.e. protocol://host
  # e.g. http://localhost:8082

  # loadBalanceVersion identifies which cluster this instance will belong to
  # when deploying multiple instances of the micro-service.

  loadBalanceVersion: cluster1


# auth configures authentication/authorization values.
auth:

  # tokenKeyFile defines the location of the file containing the token key used
  # by the authentication micro-service for JWT generation.
  tokenKeyFile: /etc/imagems/keys/jwt_sha256.key

  # genAPIKeyFile defines the location of the file containing general API
  # key if needed. Any next line or space characters will be treated as part
  # of the API key.

# database contains configuration values for accessing CockroachDB as the
# persistent store for the micro-service.
# For documentation on getting these values, visit https://www.cockroachlabs.com
database:
  # user - The user to sign in as
  user: root
  # password - The user's password
  password:
  # host - The host to connect to. Values that start with / are for unix domain
  # sockets. (default is localhost)
  host:
  # port - The port to bind to. (default is 5432)
  port: 26257
  # dbname - The name of the database to connect to
  dbName: imagems
  # connect_timeout - Maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Zero or not
  # specified means wait indefinitely.
  connectTimeout:
  # sslmode - Whether or not to use SSL (default is require).
  # Valid values are:
  # disable     - No SSL
  # require     - Always SSL (skip verification)
  # verify-ca   - Always SSL (verify that the certificate presented
  #               by the server was signed by a trusted CA)
  # verify-full - Always SSL (verify that the certification presented by the
  #               server was signed by a trusted CA and the server host name
  #               matches the one in the certificate)
  sslMode: verify-ca
  # sslcert - Cert file location. The file must contain PEM encoded data.
  sslCert: /etc/cockroachdb/certs/node.crt
  # sslkey - Key file location. The file must contain PEM encoded data.
  sslKey: /etc/cockroachdb/certs/node.key
  # sslrootcert - The location of the root certificate file. The file must
  # contain PEM encoded data.
